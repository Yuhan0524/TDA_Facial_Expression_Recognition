- This is the supplement for my summer research program with the topic "Topological Data Analysis for Facial Expression Recognition"

- I would like to extend my gratitude for NTU SPMS, the Odyssey Programme for this wonderful experience, Prof Xia and Mr Wee for their guidance.

Abstract
----
- We introduce 2 ways of using Topological Data Analysis(TDA) to generate topological features of 7 different facial expressions including angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, and surprise. 

- We apply the TDA methods to JAFFE and FER2013 datasets and try to conduct a dimensionality reduction of features for machine learning through TDA. 

Motivation
----
- I did a presentation about PCA and eigenface for face recognition during last semster, so I'm quite interested in Computer Vision. 
  When considering for the project topic of Odyssey, I thought of CV topics directly.
  Because human face have topological features, TDA may be appliable for getting features.(Actually the result for my project is not good - I think some adjustment can be done - more than what I can handle currently anyway QAQ)

- With the impression of two references, I have some ideas for this project topic
